Biessels GJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>This paper appears in a special issue of the European Journal of Pharmacology that commemorates the retirement of Professor Willem Hendrik Gispen as distinguished professor of Utrecht University and as editor of the European Journal of Pharmacology. The paper provides an overview of a research line on the impact of diabetes on cognition that we started together 20 years ago, and that continues to this day. I will report how we more or less stumbled upon this topic, that was understudied, but proved to be of definite clinical relevance. I will discuss how we tried to establish animal models, how developments from clinical and experimental studies from around the world led us to reconsider our concepts, and how findings from research on diabetic neuropathy, insulin signaling in the brain, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and vascular disease and stroke converged and helped to create new ideas and refute others. This voyage has not ended yet, because the ultimate goal is to offer patients with diabetes treatment that can protect them against accelerated cognitive decline. Although this could take another 20 years, the research from Willem Hendrik and his group brought us an important step in the right direction. </em></small><br>[ID: 23872409]"

Ten Brink AF, Hajos TR, van Bennekom C, Nachtegaal J, Meulenbelt HE, Fleuren JF, Kouwenhoven M, Luijkx MM, Wijffels MP, Post MW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The aim of this study was to identify predictors, available at admission, of physical independence at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Secondary aims were to identify predictors of functional gain and length of stay (LOS). We included 1310 adult stroke patients who were admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in five Dutch rehabilitation centres. Data on the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Clinical Rehabilitation at admission and discharge (physical and cognitive independence, mood, pain and fatigue), age, sex and in a subsample stroke characteristics as well were collected. A prediction model was created using random coefficient analysis. None of the stroke characteristics were independently associated with physical independence or functional gain at discharge, or LOS. Higher physical and cognitive independence scores and severe pain at admission were predictors of higher physical independence scores at discharge. Furthermore, lower physical independence scores, higher cognitive independence scores, less pain at admission and younger age predicted more functional gain. Finally, lower physical and cognitive independence scores at admission and younger age predicted longer LOS. Physical independence at admission was the most robust predictor for rehabilitation outcome in a Dutch rehabilitation setting. To a lesser extent, age, cognitive independence and pain predicted rehabilitation outcome after stroke. Treatment of cognition and pain should be taken into account during rehabilitation. Further work needs to be carried out to establish whether focusing on these factors improves outcome after rehabilitation.</em></small><br>[ID: 27749516]"

A total of 121 mild-to-moderate stroke patients, who had a paid job at the time of their stroke were included (a) to quantify RTW and work satisfaction one-year post-stroke (using the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation) and (b) to determine factors predicting RTW post-stroke, based on stroke-related, personal and neuropsychological variables. Half of the patients were not in work (28%) or were working less (22%) than pre-stroke. Ninety percent of those in fulltime employment post-stroke were satisfied with their occupational situation, against 36% of the unemployed participants. In regards to factors predicting RTW, global cognitive functioning (r = .19, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and depressive symptoms (r = -.16, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) at two months post-stroke onset were associated with return to work within one year. Only global cognitive functioning was an independent predictor of RTW (11.3% variance, p = .013). Although the explained variance was not that high, neuropsychological factors probably play a pivotal role in returning to work and should be taken into account during rehabilitation after mild and moderate stroke.</em></small><br>[ID: 28441897]"

Understanding their relationship could inform treatment approaches to improve participation. We investigated the relationship between social cognition and participation in the long term after stroke. Of 395 patients participating in a large prospective cohort study, cross-sectional data were available at 3-4 years post-stroke of 118 patients on tests for emotion recognition, theory of mind, empathy, and behaviour regulation. Participation was assessed with the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation - Participation (USER-P). Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between social cognitive domains and participation. The majority suffered from minor stroke (83.1% scored NIHSS 0-4). Only behaviour regulation was related to participation restrictions in bivariate analysis, but social cognitive impairments did not predict participation restrictions in multivariate regression in this group. To conclude, in a sample of minor stroke patients with mild impairments in theory of mind, emotion recognition and behavioural control, there were no associations with restrictions in participation. Research should examine whether a relationship is present in patients with more severe stroke. In addition, measuring social aspects of participation is necessary to further unravel this relationship, to determine treatment targets for improving participation.</em></small><br>[ID: 31854264]"

Statistical analysis included ANOVA, path analysis, and multiple logistic regression. Stressed workers showed lower work engagement and more cognitive complaints, even after adjusting for demographic variables.

Santos S, Brech GC, Alonso AC, Greve JMD<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em> Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the brake response time of drivers with paraplegia (who use hand control) with drivers without paraplegia (who use their feet) in a virtual driving simulator brake test. Additionally, we aimed to predict and evaluate the association of virtual brake response time with sociodemographic, motor and cognitive variables. Methods: 40 male adult drivers, with paraplegia (n = 20, mean age 38.1 ± 3.6 years) and without paraplegia (n = 20, mean age 38.0 ± 5.8 years), with valid driver licenses, had their brake response time evaluated in an automatic transmission car simulator. Non-disabled drivers were tested with conventional foot controls, while paraplegic drivers used hand controls. Drivers with paraplegia performed simple, choice and go/no-go reaction time tests as neuropsychological evaluations. Student's t -test was used to examine the differences of driving simulator brake response time between groups. Pearson coefficient verified the correlation of driving simulator brake response time with years of driving, length of disability, handgrip strength and neuropsychological tests of the paraplegic drivers. A regression model was developed to describe the mean of driving simulator brake response time using the backward elimination method for model adjustment selecting the explanatory variables. Results: Differences of simulator brake response time between groups were not statistically significant (non-paraplegic drivers = 0.90 seconds; paraplegic drivers = 0.92 seconds, p &gt; 0.05). Years of driving significantly correlates with brake response time of paraplegic driver (r= -58, p = 0.009). Linear regression analyses indicated that years of schooling and years of driving (explanatory variables) explained 60.2% of driving simulator brake response time for the drivers with paraplegia. Driving simulator brake response time showed no difference between drivers with and without paraplegia. Years of driving and schooling were the main predictors of braking performance in drivers with paraplegia measured in a driving simulator. </em></small><br>[ID: 33661082]"

In the present study, involvement of synaptic Zn(2+) in stress-induced attenuation of CA1 LTP was examined in hippocampal slices from young rats after exposure to tail suspension stress for 30s, which significantly increased serum corticosterone. Stress-induced attenuation of CA1 LTP was ameliorated by administration of clioquinol, a membrane permeable zinc chelator, to rats prior to exposure to stress, implying that the reduction of synaptic Zn(2+) by clioquinol participates in this amelioration. To pursue the involvement of corticosterone-mediated Zn(2+) signal in the attenuated CA1 LTP by stress, dynamics of synaptic Zn(2+) was checked in hippocampal slices exposed to corticosterone. Corticosterone increased extracellular Zn(2+) levels measured with ZnAF-2 dose-dependently, as well as the intracellular Ca(2+) levels measured with calcium orange AM, suggesting that corticosterone excites zincergic neurons in the hippocampus and increases Zn(2+) release from the neuron terminals. Intracellular Zn(2+) levels measured with ZnAF-2DA were also increased dose-dependently, but not in the coexistence of CaEDTA, a membrane-impermeable zinc chelator, suggesting that intracellular Zn(2+) levels is increased by the influx of extracellular Zn(2+). Furthermore, corticosterone-induced attenuation of CA1 LTP was abolished in the coexistence of CaEDTA.

Martin A, Santos LR<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Young infants' successful performance on false belief tasks has led several researchers to argue that there may be a core knowledge system for representing the beliefs of other agents, emerging early in human development and constraining automatic belief processing into adulthood. One way to investigate this purported core belief representation system is to examine whether non-human primates share such a system. Although non-human primates have historically performed poorly on false belief tasks that require executive function capacities, little work has explored how primates perform on more automatic measures of belief processing. To get at this issue, we modified Kovács et al. (2010)'s test of automatic belief representation to examine whether one non-human primate species--the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta)--is automatically influenced by another agent's beliefs when tracking an object's location. Monkeys saw an event in which a human agent watched an apple move back and forth between two boxes and an outcome in which one box was revealed to be empty. By occluding segments of the apple's movement from either the monkey or the agent, we manipulated both the monkeys' belief (true or false) and agent's belief (true or false) about the final location of the apple. We found that monkeys looked longer at events that violated their own beliefs than at events that were consistent with their beliefs. In contrast to human infants, however, monkeys' expectations were not influenced by another agent's beliefs, suggesting that belief representation may be an aspect of core knowledge unique to humans.</em></small><br>[ID: 24374209]"

Moher J, Song JH<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The motor system is tightly linked with perception and cognition. Recent studies have shown that even anticipated biophysical action costs associated with competing response options can be incorporated into decision-making processes. As a result, choices associated with high energy costs are less likely to be selected. However, some action costs may be harder to predict. For example, a person choosing among apples at a grocery store may change his or her mind suddenly about which apple to put into the cart. This change of mind may be reflected in motor output as the initial decision triggers a motor response toward a Granny Smith that is subsequently redirected toward a Red Delicious. In the present study, to examine how motor costs associated with changes of mind affect perceptual decision making, participants performed a difficult random dot–motion discrimination task in which they had to indicate the direction of motion by reaching to one of two response options. Although each response box was always equidistant from the starting position, the physical distance between the two response options was varied. We found that when the boxes were far apart from one another, and thus changes of mind incurred greater redirection motor costs, change-of-mind frequency decreased while latency to initiate movement increased. This occurred even when response box distance varied randomly from trial to trial and was cued only 1 s before each trial began. Thus, we demonstrated that observers can dynamically adjust perceptual decision-making processes to avoid high motor costs incurred by a change of mind.</em></small><br>[ID: 24986186]"

Lederman RJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Frederick Delius was born in Yorkshire, England, on June 29, 1862, the son of German immigrants. He showed early musical talent but his father, a wealthy wool merchant, insisted he pursue a business career. After several failures, including an assignment managing an orange grove near Jacksonville, Florida, his father agreed to support his musical studies in Leipzig, assuming he would then become self-sufficient. Delius spent most of his adult life in France, living with and ultimately marrying Jelka Rosen, a painter of independent means, composing prolifically, and being sexually promiscuous both before and after starting life with Jelka. He contracted syphilis in 1895 and manifestations of neurosyphilis appeared in 1910. Despite periods of relative good health over the ensuing 10 years, he became progressively disabled from 1920 on, ultimately quadriparetic and blind but with preserved cognition and musical inspiration. In his final years, he completed several compositions aided by a young British musician, Eric Fenby, who served as his amanuensis and caregiver, along with Jelka, to his death on June 10, 1934. </em></small><br>[ID: 25684292]"
